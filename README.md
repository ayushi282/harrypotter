Create a simple single page application that acts as an index/catalog of Spells from the Harry Potter API (https://docs.potterdb.com/apis/rest)

This application should contain a page that shows all the Spells, with search and pagination (the API contains around 312 spells)

The list can contain some basic details of the vehicle, such as model, vehicle class and cost

(Optionally, you may also implement an option to filter the spells by category)

When you click on a particular spell, it should show the details of the selected spell (this can be in the form of a pop-up modal, or a separate page)

The details should include at least: name, category, effect, incantation, creator and a link to the wiki (you may use the other fields/data provided by the API as/if you want)


The base url for the graphql API is:

https://api.potterdb.com/v1/spells
